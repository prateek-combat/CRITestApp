  - `LinkManagementSection`: Tabbed interface for link management
  - `LinkBuilder`: Visual workflow for creating links
  - `TimeSlotCalendar`: Calendar view for time slots
  - `JobProfileDetailsModal`: Detailed view with tabs

### 2. Link Management UI

- **After**: 
  - Dedicated link management section with tabs
  - Clear distinction between public and time-restricted links
  - Visual link builder with step-by-step workflow
  - Search and filtering capabilities
  - Bulk operations support

### 3. Time Slot Visualization
- **Before**: Time slots listed in expandable rows

- **After**: Card-based layout with better spacing and visual hierarchy

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Backup Current Implementation
```bash
cp src/app/admin/job-profiles/page.tsx src/app/admin/job-profiles/page-backup.tsx
```

### Step 2: Install New Components
All new components are already created in:
- `/src/components/admin/job-profiles/`

### Step 3: Update the Page
To use the improved version:
```bash
cp src/app/admin/job-profiles/page-improved.tsx src/app/admin/job-profiles/page.tsx
