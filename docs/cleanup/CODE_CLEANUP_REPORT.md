# Code Cleanup Report - CRITestApp

## Summary

After analyzing the codebase, I've identified several areas that need cleanup:

### 1. Console.log Statements (99 files affected)

Found extensive use of console.log, console.error, and console.warn statements throughout the codebase. These should be removed or replaced with proper logging mechanisms.

**Most affected files:**
- `/src/app/api/admin/leaderboard/route.ts` - Multiple console.error and console.warn statements
- `/src/app/api/questions/import/route.ts` - Debug logging in production
- `/src/lib/proctor/useLiveFlags.ts` - Console.warn for error handling
- `/src/app/api/admin/proctor/trigger-analysis/[attemptId]/route.ts` - Extensive console.log statements

### 2. TODO/FIXME Comments (4 files)

**Files with TODO comments:**
- `/src/app/api/admin/job-profiles/invitations/route.ts` (line 68): `// TODO: Add test attempts data if needed`
- `/src/app/admin/layout.tsx` (line 199): `// TODO: Add settings functionality later`
- `/src/app/api/admin/analytics/test-attempts/route.ts` - Contains TODO comment
- `/src/lib/logger.ts` - Contains TODO/FIXME comment

### 3. Large Blocks of Commented-Out Code

**Most problematic file:**
- `/src/app/api/admin/proctor/trigger-analysis/[attemptId]/route.ts` (lines 94-198)
  - Contains multiple large blocks of commented-out code for AWS Rekognition, Google Vision API, and various job queue implementations
  - These should be removed as they're not being used and clutter the codebase

### 4. Debug Utilities

- `/src/app/api/debug-utils.ts` - While this is a proper debug logging utility, it's currently enabled in production (`process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'`). This should be reviewed to ensure debug logs aren't exposed in production.

### 5. Files with Excessive Comments

**Files with 20+ comment lines:**
- `/src/app/api/admin/leaderboard/route.ts` - 55 comment lines
- `/src/app/api/questions/import/route.ts` - 47 comment lines
- `/src/app/api/admin/proctor/trigger-analysis/[attemptId]/route.ts` - 37 comment lines

Many of these are legitimate documentation comments, but some files contain excessive inline comments that could be cleaned up.

## Recommendations

1. **Replace console.log statements** with proper logging using the existing logger utility
2. **Remove commented-out code blocks** especially in the proctor analysis file
3. **Address TODO comments** - either implement the functionality or remove if no longer needed
4. **Review debug utilities** to ensure they're not logging sensitive information in production
5. **Clean up excessive inline comments** that don't add value

## Priority Items for Immediate Cleanup

1. Remove the large blocks of commented-out code in `/src/app/api/admin/proctor/trigger-analysis/[attemptId]/route.ts`
2. Replace console.log statements with proper logging in critical API routes
3. Address the TODO comments in job profiles and admin layout
4. Review and potentially disable debug logging in production environments
