## üîß Technical Details

### **API Endpoints**

#### **Get Notification Settings**
```http
GET /api/tests/[id]/notifications
```

#### **Update Notification Settings**
```http
PUT /api/tests/[id]/notifications
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "emailNotificationsEnabled": true,

}
```

### **Email Service Architecture**

**Components**:
- `EmailService`: Main service class handling email logic
- `NotificationSettings`: Type definitions for settings
- `TestAnalytics`: Performance calculation and analysis
- `EmailTemplate`: HTML email generation

**Features**:
- **Async Processing**: Email sending doesn't block test submission
- **Error Handling**: Failed emails don't affect test completion
- **Environment Detection**: Development mode uses test SMTP
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive error logging and success tracking

### **Analytics Calculation**

**Ranking Algorithm**:
```typescript
const rank = betterScores.length + 1; // 1-based ranking
const percentile = (worseScores / (totalAttempts - 1)) * 100;
```

**Difficulty Assessment**:
- **Easy**: Average score ‚â• 80%
- **Medium**: Average score 50-79%
- **Hard**: Average score < 50%

**Performance Areas** (Basic Implementation):
- **Strengths**: Identified based on score thresholds
- **Improvements**: Areas needing attention based on performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Mode

### **Testing Emails**

In development mode, the system uses Ethereal Email for testing:
- No real emails are sent
- Emails can be viewed in Ethereal's web interface
- Perfect for testing email templates and functionality

### **Email Preview**

The settings modal includes a preview section showing:
- Email subject format
- Number of recipients
- Content summary (with/without analytics)

## üö® Error Handling

### **Graceful Failures**
- Email sending failures don't prevent test completion
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- User experience remains unaffected by email issues

### **Validation**
- Email address format validation
- Required field validation
- Duplicate email prevention

## üìà Monitoring & Logs

### **Success Logging**
```
Test completion notification sent for test [testId] to [count] recipients
```

### **Error Logging**
```
Failed to send test completion email notification: [error details]
Failed to send public test completion email notification: [error details]
```
