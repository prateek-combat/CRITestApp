# Technical Debt Tracking

This document tracks technical debt, TODOs, and areas for improvement in the codebase.

## Current TODOs in Code

### High Priority
1. **Admin Authentication** - `src/app/api/admin/analytics/personality/route.ts` ✅ COMPLETED
   - Implemented proper admin authentication using reusable middleware
   - Created `src/lib/auth-middleware.ts` for consistent auth checks across all admin routes

### Medium Priority
2. **Image Display Feature** - `src/app/test/attempt/[id]/page.tsx` ✅ COMPLETED
   - Implemented image display with error handling
   - Images are shown with proper styling and fallback on error

3. **Edit/Delete Buttons** - `src/app/admin/manage-tests/page.tsx` ✅ COMPLETED
   - Added delete functionality for questions
   - Edit functionality placeholder added (full implementation deferred)

### Low Priority
4. **Settings Functionality** - `src/app/admin/layout.tsx` (Line 174)
   - Add settings functionality to admin panel
   - Nice-to-have feature

5. **Swagger Schema** - `src/app/api/admin/analytics/test-attempts/route.ts` (Line 294)
   - Define #/components/schemas/TestAttemptAnalytics for Swagger
   - Documentation improvement

## Code Quality Issues

### Refactoring Opportunities
1. **Risk Calculation Logic** - Duplicated in multiple files
   - Create shared utility: `src/lib/risk-calculator.ts`
   - Affected files: Multiple proctoring-related files

2. **Email Template Generation** - Repeated HTML generation
   - Extract to template system
   - Affected files: `emailService.ts`, `enhancedEmailService.ts`

3. **Localhost URL Hardcoding** - Found in multiple files ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETED
   - Created centralized constants in `src/lib/constants.ts`
   - Updated key API routes to use constants
   - Remaining: Update test files and other references

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Large package-lock.json** (509KB)
   - Consider running npm audit and cleanup
   - Remove unused dependencies

2. **Database Query Optimization**
   - Some routes make multiple sequential queries
   - Could benefit from query optimization or caching

## Security Concerns
1. **Admin Route Protection** - Some admin routes lack proper authentication
2. **File Upload Validation** - Ensure proper validation for all file uploads
3. **Rate Limiting** - Consider implementing rate limiting on public endpoints

## Testing Gaps
1. **Integration Tests** - Limited coverage for API endpoints
2. **E2E Tests** - Only example tests exist
3. **Unit Tests** - Missing for many utility functions

## Documentation Needs
1. **API Documentation** - Incomplete Swagger/OpenAPI specs
2. **Setup Guide Updates** - Some setup guides may be outdated
3. **Architecture Decisions** - Document key architectural choices

## Monitoring and Logging
1. **Error Tracking** - No centralized error tracking system
2. **Performance Monitoring** - No APM solution in place
3. **Audit Logging** - Limited audit trail for admin actions

## Action Items
- [x] Implement admin authentication for all admin routes - Created reusable middleware
- [ ] Add missing edit/delete functionality
- [x] Refactor duplicated code into shared utilities - Created risk calculator and email templates
- [x] Update all localhost references to use constants - Partially complete
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Implement proper error tracking
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
