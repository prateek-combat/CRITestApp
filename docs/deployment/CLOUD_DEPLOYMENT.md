# Cloud Deployment Guide: AI Analysis on Vercel & Neon

## Current Status ✅

Your app now has **enhanced lightweight AI analysis** that works perfectly on Vercel and Neon:

- ✅ Real behavioral analysis using proctoring events
- ✅ Risk scoring based on tab switches, focus loss, suspicious activities
- ✅ Fast execution (< 1 second)
- ✅ No external dependencies required
- ✅ Works within Vercel's free tier

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Current Enhanced Analysis (Recommended for Start)

**What it does:**

- Analyzes behavioral patterns from proctoring events
- Calculates risk scores based on suspicious activities
- Provides recommendations based on risk levels
- Uses real data: tab switches, focus loss, copy/paste, dev tools, etc.

**Deployment:**

```bash
# Deploy to Vercel (current setup)
vercel --prod

# Your Neon database is already configured
# No additional setup needed!
```

**Cost:** FREE on Vercel Hobby + Neon Free tier

---

### Option 2: Cloud AI Services Integration

For **real video/image analysis**, integrate with cloud AI services:

#### AWS Rekognition Setup

```bash
# Install AWS SDK
npm install aws-sdk

# Add to .env.local
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_SNS_TOPIC_ARN=arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789:proctoring-analysis
AWS_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/RekognitionServiceRole
```

#### Google Vision API Setup

```bash
# Install Google Cloud Vision
npm install @google-cloud/vision

# Add to .env.local
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEY_PATH=./google-cloud-key.json
```

**Cost:**

- AWS Rekognition: ~$0.10-0.15 per minute of video
- Google Vision: ~$1.50 per 1000 images

**Pros:** Real AI analysis of video/audio
**Cons:** Additional cost, complexity

---

### Option 3: External Heavy Processing

For **advanced video analysis** (face recognition, object detection):

#### Using Upstash Redis Queue

```bash
# Install Upstash Redis
npm install @upstash/redis

# Add to .env.local
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-redis.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_token
```

#### Using Inngest (Serverless Jobs)

```bash
# Install Inngest
npm install inngest

# Add to .env.local
INNGEST_EVENT_KEY=your_event_key
INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY=your_signing_key
```

#### External Processing Server

Deploy the Python worker on:

- **Railway** (recommended): `railway up`
- **Google Cloud Run**: Deploy Docker container
- **AWS Lambda**: For short video clips
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Easy Docker deployment

## Recommended Architecture for Production

### Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds)

1. **Immediate Analysis (Vercel)**:

   - Behavioral analysis (current implementation)
   - Quick risk assessment
   - User gets immediate feedback

2. **Deep Analysis (External Service)**:
   - Video processing with OpenCV/face_recognition
   - Audio analysis
   - Object detection
   - Updates results asynchronously

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: Deploy with enhanced behavioral analysis ✅
2. **Phase 2**: Add cloud AI services for basic video analysis
3. **Phase 3**: Implement external processing for advanced features

## Environment Variables for Vercel

Add these to your Vercel project settings:

```bash
# Database (already configured)
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_connection_string

# Authentication (already configured)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app

# Optional: Cloud AI Services
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id

# Optional: External Processing
ANALYSIS_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-worker.railway.app/analyze
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_redis_url
```

## Cost Comparison

| Option                | Setup Effort | Monthly Cost | Analysis Quality                   |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Current Enhanced      | ✅ None      | 🆓 $0        | ⭐⭐⭐ Good behavioral analysis    |
| + Cloud AI            | 🔧 Medium    | 💰 $10-50    | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good video analysis       |
| + External Processing | 🔧 High      | 💰 $5-20     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent full analysis |

## Quick Start (Current Setup)

Your app is **already ready** for production! The enhanced analysis provides:

1. **Real-time behavioral analysis**
2. **Risk scoring and recommendations**
3. **Beautiful admin interface**
4. **Scalable architecture**

Just deploy to Vercel:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test current analysis** - It's already working great!
2. **Monitor usage** - See if you need more advanced features
3. **Add cloud AI gradually** - Only if you need video analysis
4. **Scale as needed** - Start simple, add complexity when necessary

The current implementation gives you 80% of the value with 20% of the complexity! 🚀
