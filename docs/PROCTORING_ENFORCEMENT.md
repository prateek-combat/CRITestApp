# Proctoring Enforcement System

## Overview

The proctoring system has been updated to **enforce** camera and microphone permissions for all tests. Users can no longer bypass proctoring requirements and start tests without granting proper permissions.

## Key Changes

### 1. Mandatory Permission Checks
- **Camera access is required** - Tests cannot start without camera permission
- **Microphone access is required** - Tests cannot start without microphone permission
- **No bypass option** - Users cannot "Continue Anyway" if permissions are denied

### 2. System Compatibility Checker Updates
- Modified `SystemCompatibilityChecker` component to block test start if camera/microphone fail
- Added clear error messages and retry functionality
- Removed "Continue Anyway" option for failed camera/microphone checks

### 3. Database Schema Updates
- `proctoringEnabled` now defaults to `true` for new test attempts
- Added permission tracking in both `TestAttempt` and `PublicTestAttempt` tables
- `permissionsGranted` field tracks actual permission status

### 4. API Endpoints
- **New endpoint**: `/api/test-attempts/[id]/permissions` - Updates permission status for regular tests
- **New endpoint**: `/api/public-test-attempts/[id]/permissions` - Updates permission status for public tests
- Both endpoints track `permissionsGranted` and `proctoringEnabled` status

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
- Proctoring recorder now throws errors instead of silently failing
- Test taking page shows clear error messages when proctoring fails
- Users are prompted to refresh and retry if permissions fail

## User Experience Flow

### Before Starting Test
1. **System Compatibility Check** - User must grant camera and microphone permissions
2. **Permission Validation** - System verifies permissions are actually granted
3. **Database Update** - Permission status is saved to database
4. **Test Start** - Only allowed if all permissions are granted

### During Test
1. **Proctoring Active** - Camera and microphone recording starts immediately
2. **Continuous Monitoring** - System monitors for permission changes
3. **Error Handling** - Test stops if proctoring fails during execution

### Permission Denied Scenarios
- **Clear error messages** explaining why permissions are required
- **Retry button** to refresh page and attempt permission grant again
- **No test access** until permissions are properly granted

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
- `SystemCompatibilityChecker.tsx` - Enforces permission requirements
- `TestTakingPage` - Handles permission validation and error states
- Enhanced error display for proctoring failures

### Backend Services
- Permission tracking APIs for both regular and public tests
- Database updates to track permission status
- Enhanced proctoring recorder with strict permission enforcement

### Database Changes
- Default `proctoringEnabled: true` for all new test attempts
- Existing tests updated to enable proctoring
- Permission status tracking for audit purposes

## Migration Script

A migration script `enable-proctoring-for-all-tests.js` was executed to:
- Enable proctoring for all existing test attempts (33 regular + 92 public)
- Reset permission status for incomplete attempts (1 regular + 49 public)
- Ensure all future tests require proctoring

## Testing the Implementation

### To Test Permission Enforcement:
1. Start a new test attempt
2. Deny camera or microphone permission when prompted
3. Verify that test cannot be started
4. Grant permissions and verify test can proceed

### To Test During Test:
1. Start a test with proper permissions
2. Revoke camera/microphone permission during test
3. Verify test stops with appropriate error message

## Security Benefits

- **Prevents cheating** by ensuring all tests are proctored
- **Audit trail** of permission grants in database
- **Consistent enforcement** across all test types (regular and public)
- **No bypass mechanisms** for users to avoid proctoring

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing incomplete tests will require permission re-grant
- Completed tests retain their original proctoring status
- No impact on historical test data or analytics

## Future Enhancements

- Add permission status to admin analytics
- Implement real-time permission monitoring
- Add automated alerts for permission failures
- Enhanced proctoring analysis with permission correlation
