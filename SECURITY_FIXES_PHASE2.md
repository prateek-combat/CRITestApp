# Security Fixes - Phase 2 Complete

## Summary

I've completed Phase 2 of the security improvements, implementing comprehensive security headers, rate limiting, and fixing several vulnerabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Security Headers Implementation
**File**: `next.config.js`
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Restricts resource loading to trusted sources
- **X-Frame-Options**: DENY - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: nosniff - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy**: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- **X-XSS-Protection**: 1; mode=block - Legacy XSS protection
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts camera/microphone access
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Forces HTTPS for 1 year

### 2. ✅ CORS Configuration
**File**: `src/lib/cors.ts`
- Created flexible CORS utility
- Environment-based origin whitelist
- Proper preflight request handling
- Credentials support with origin validation

### 3. ✅ Rate Limiting Implementation
**File**: `src/lib/rate-limit.ts`
- In-memory rate limiter for development
- Different limits for different endpoint types:
  - Auth endpoints: 5 requests/minute
  - Public APIs: 30 requests/minute
  - Standard APIs: 100 requests/minute
  - File uploads: 10 uploads/5 minutes
  - Sensitive operations: 3 requests/5 minutes
- Proper rate limit headers in responses

### 4. ✅ File Upload Security
**File**: `src/app/api/proctor/upload-frames/route.ts`
- Added rate limiting (10 uploads per 5 minutes)
- File size limits (10MB total, 5MB per file)
- File type validation (only JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- Proper error messages for violations

### 5. ✅ XSS Vulnerability Fixes
**File**: `src/app/admin/analytics/analysis/[attemptId]/page.tsx`
- Removed `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage
- Now safely renders user content as text

### 6. ✅ Email Template Security
**File**: `src/lib/email.ts`
- Added HTML escaping function
- All user input is now escaped in email templates
- Prevents XSS attacks via email content

### 7. ✅ YouTube Embed Validation
**File**: `src/components/ui/video/YouTubeEmbed.tsx`
- Validates video ID format (11 characters, alphanumeric + dash/underscore)
- Sanitizes video ID before embedding
- Shows error message for invalid IDs

## Security Headers Explained

### Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
The implemented CSP allows:
- Scripts from self, Google domains (for OAuth), and YouTube
- Styles from self and Google Fonts
- Images from self, data URLs, and Google services
- Frames only from YouTube and Google (for OAuth)
- No object embeds allowed
- Form submissions only to self

### Other Headers
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents the site from being embedded in frames
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts browser features to enhance privacy
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Ensures HTTPS is always used

## Testing the Security Improvements

### 1. Test Security Headers
```bash
curl -I https://your-domain.com
```
Should show all security headers in response.

### 2. Test Rate Limiting
```bash
# Make multiple requests quickly
for i in {1..10}; do curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/proctor/upload-frames; done
```
Should get 429 errors after limit is exceeded.

### 3. Test XSS Protection
- Try inserting HTML in question options
- Should display as plain text, not rendered HTML

### 4. Test File Upload Validation
- Try uploading non-image files → Should be rejected
- Try uploading files > 5MB → Should be rejected

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Rate Limiting**: 
   - Replace in-memory store with Redis or Upstash
   - Consider IP-based and user-based limits

2. **CSP Refinement**:
   - Remove 'unsafe-inline' once all inline scripts are externalized
   - Add nonce-based CSP for better security

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up alerts for rate limit violations
   - Monitor CSP violation reports

4. **Additional Headers**:
   - Consider adding `Expect-CT` header
   - Add `Feature-Policy` for more granular control

## Next Steps

### Phase 3 - Client-Side Security (Remaining)
- [ ] Remove sensitive data from localStorage
- [ ] Implement secure session management
- [ ] Add CSRF protection
- [ ] Remove console.error statements with sensitive data

### Phase 4 - Error Handling & Monitoring
- [ ] Sanitize all error responses
- [ ] Implement structured logging
- [ ] Add security event monitoring

The application now has significantly improved security with proper headers, rate limiting, and input validation. These changes protect against common web vulnerabilities including XSS, clickjacking, and abuse through rate limiting.
