# Security Fixes - Phase 1 Complete

## Summary

I've completed Phase 1 of the critical security fixes for the CRITestApp. These changes address the most critical vulnerabilities that posed immediate security risks.

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Removed Hardcoded Credentials
- **File**: `src/lib/auth-simple.ts`
- **Change**: Removed hardcoded 'local-admin' credentials
- **Impact**: Prevents unauthorized super admin access

### 2. ✅ Created Secure Environment Configuration
- **File**: `.env.example`
- **Change**: Created template with placeholder values and documentation
- **Impact**: Helps developers set up secure configurations

### 3. ✅ Re-enabled Authentication Middleware
- **File**: `src/middleware.ts`
- **Change**: Implemented proper JWT-based authentication middleware
- **Features**:
  - Protects all admin routes
  - Protects sensitive API endpoints
  - Adds user info to request headers
  - Returns proper HTTP status codes (401/403)

### 4. ✅ Secured File Upload Endpoint
- **File**: `src/app/api/proctor/upload-frames/route.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added authentication requirement
  - Added authorization check (user must own the test attempt)
  - Admins can upload for any attempt

### 5. ✅ Secured File Download Endpoint
- **File**: `src/app/api/files/[id]/route.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added authentication requirement
  - Implemented comprehensive authorization checks
  - Added security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options)
  - Changed cache from public to private

### 6. ✅ Removed Debug Endpoints
- **Deleted**: `src/app/api/test-login/route.ts`
- **Deleted**: `src/app/api/auth-debug/route.ts`
- **Impact**: Removes endpoints that exposed sensitive information

### 7. ✅ Updated Documentation
- **File**: `README.md`
- **Changes**:
  - Added comprehensive security configuration section
  - Documented environment variable best practices
  - Added security best practices guide

### 8. ✅ Fixed Admin Login Page
- **File**: `src/app/admin/login/page.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed hardcoded demo credentials
- **Impact**: Forces use of proper authentication flow

## Next Steps - Remaining Phases

### Phase 2 - Security Headers & Protection (High Priority)
- [ ] Implement CORS configuration
- [ ] Add security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- [ ] Add rate limiting to all API endpoints
- [ ] Fix XSS vulnerabilities (dangerouslySetInnerHTML)
- [ ] Escape user input in email templates

### Phase 3 - Client-Side Security (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Remove sensitive data from localStorage
- [ ] Implement server-side session management
- [ ] Add server validation for all authorization checks
- [ ] Remove console.error statements with sensitive data

### Phase 4 - Error Handling & Monitoring (Low Priority)
- [ ] Sanitize all error responses
- [ ] Remove stack traces from production
- [ ] Implement proper logging without exposing sensitive data
- [ ] Add structured error handling middleware

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Authentication Flow**:
   - Verify login works with Google OAuth
   - Confirm middleware blocks unauthenticated requests
   - Test role-based access control

2. **Test File Security**:
   - Verify only authorized users can upload files
   - Confirm file download requires authentication
   - Test that users can only access their own files

3. **Environment Setup**:
   - Test with `.env.example` as template
   - Verify app starts with proper environment variables

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Action Required**:
1. Rotate all exposed credentials immediately (database, OAuth, email)
2. Ensure `.env` files are never committed to version control
3. Review and update any deployment scripts that might contain credentials
4. Update all team members about the security changes

The application is now significantly more secure, but please proceed with implementing the remaining phases to achieve comprehensive security.
